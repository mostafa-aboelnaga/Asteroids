Here's a trailer I made for the game, just to hype things up üò§üî•

<br>

## üòÅ **Quick start**

<br>

First, [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and install **Python**. Version `3.7` or higher is recommended.


Let's now install our dependencies **required modules** using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Next, make sure you are in the root directory of this project and then just run the `Asteroids.py` python file

```bash
python Asteroids.py
```

An alternative way to try the game out is to run `Asteroids.exe` directly!

<br>
That's all you need to know to start! ‚úÖ
